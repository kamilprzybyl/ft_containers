# ft_containers

## Foreword
A container is a holder object that stores a collection of other objects (its elements). They are implemented as class templates, which allows a great flexibility in the types supported as elements.

## Goal
This project consist of a few container types of the C++ standard template library and additional tools i.e. iterators
- [x] vector
- [ ] map
- [ ] stack
- [ ] set
- [x] iterators_traits
- [x] reverse_iterator
- [ ] enable_if
- [ ] is_integral
- [x] equal
- [x] lexicographical_compare
- [ ] std::pair
- [ ] std::make_pair
