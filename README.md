# ft_containers

## Foreword
A container is a holder object that stores a collection of other objects (its elements). They are implemented as class templates, which allows a great flexibility in the types supported as elements.

## Goal
This project consist of a few container types of the C++ standard template library and additional tools i.e. iterators
- [x] vector
- [x] map
- [x] stack
- [ ] set
- [x] iterators_traits
- [x] reverse_iterator
- [x] enable_if
- [x] is_integral
- [x] equal
- [x] lexicographical_compare
- [x] std::pair
- [x] std::make_pair

## Technologies
- Data structures and algorithms: implementation of a balanced tree (red-black tree)
- Iterators
- C++ generic programming (templates)
- SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)
